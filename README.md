# flanders
An old (about 2002) thread diagram generator for flanders grounds (bobbin lace)
republished at http://jo-pol.github.io/flanders.
The main page explains how the JavaScript triggered by the web form uses tiled images of stitches.

Various detours an freshly started projects since these old days
gave birth to the still evolving [GroundForge] supporting limitless types of grounds and stitches.

Sorry about the Dutch variable names in the JavaScript and some of the filenames.
The original pages used to be multilingual with Dutch as primary audience.
The multilingual versions took too much effort to recover,
an English user interface reaches a wider audience.
